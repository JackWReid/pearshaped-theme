PearShaped Theme
================

This is a repo for the theme that runs PearShaped's website, pearshapedexeter.com. PearShaped runs on Tumblr as a hacky CMS, and thus the theme file is a fairly standard framwork containing the global scripts, meta tags, and stylesheets. Then the necessary Tumblr block tags are used as content hooks, wherein the page and post files are inserted. If you see a CSS selector that isn't referenced in the the theme.css, it'll be because it's in a page or post HTML file.


The Cascade
-----------

The CSS cascade goes as follows:
- reset.css
- type.css
- layout.css
- app.css

## reset.css ##
This is just the standard Meyer CSS Reset. It goes at the top so as to stop user agent stylesheets ruining the fun further down the cascade.

## type.css ##
